This is the childhood game tik-tak-toe that we all know and love. This game is played in a 3x3 matrix with each button taking the value of the square in the matrix. Implements logic to see who wins, design a GUI for the users, make it 2-player. PLANS: Make a ai-computer bot to play against user, add a hint feature or practice mode.
